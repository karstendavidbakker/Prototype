To begin, a button feature was assembled on the Arduino Mega in order to capture when the user experienced difficulty with a particular hazard.
The Arduino was programmed to relay to the serial monitor "1'' when the button is pressed, refreshing each second.
A digital momentary push button was used in this case.
A debounce feature was used to ensure more predictable behavior.
Whilst the Arduino captures information and labels the terrain, pressing the button will transmit and log the past ten seconds of terrain info to the user's phone.

Next, the Arduino was removed from the serial connection on the PC and connected to the USB port of the Pi.
