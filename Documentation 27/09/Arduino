To begin, a button feature was assembled on the Arduino Mega in order to capture when the user experienced difficulty with a particular hazard.
The Arduino was programmed to relay to the serial monitor "1'' when the button is pressed, refreshing each second.
A digital momentary push button was used in this case.
A debounce feature was used to ensure more predictable behavior.
Whilst the Arduino captures information and labels the terrain, pressing the button will transmit and log the past ten seconds of terrain info to the user's phone.

Next, the Arduino was removed from the serial connection on the PC and connected to the USB port of the Pi.

Week 1:

To begin, a button feature was assembled on the Arduino Mega.

-Connected to DCD driver


Week 2:


Succesfully connected to the bluetooth feather
Received output on DCD driver


Goal:
Adjusted Arduino code to have button communicating with the server

- Added button characteristics (Arduino)
- reading value button by added line (Arduino)
- Changed button line for: AT+GATTADDCHAR=

- Ran "9999" as a test

- Failed to  ble.print( buttonCharId );

- Failed: Did not deliver end of string

- Adjusted MIN_LEN=1,MAX_LEN=30 to deliver required amount of variables
