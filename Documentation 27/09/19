Week 1:

To begin, a button feature was assembled on the Arduino Mega.

-Connected to DCD driver


Week 2:


Succesfully connected to the bluetooth feather
Received output on DCD driver


Goal:
Adjusted Arduino code to have button communicating with the server

- Added button characteristics (Arduino)
- reading value button by added line (Arduino)
- Changed button line for: AT+GATTADDCHAR=

- Ran "9999" as a test

- Failed to  ble.print( buttonCharId );

- Failed: Did not deliver end of string

- Adjusted MIN_LEN=1,MAX_LEN=30 to deliver required amount of variables

- Pyton: # UUID of the GATT characteristic to subscribe to button

- re-enaled: Subscribing the GATT service which was controversial?!

- Python: added: handle_button_data(handle, value_bytes)

Jordan: Arduino

Today, to begin the IMU was setup to display constant stream of data on the serial port.
Next, the button was configured and then a de-bounce was added to improve stability.
Enabled the serial monitor to display the IMU data whilst the button was pushed.
Next, a for clause was integrated into the code to record data for 10 seconds once the button was pushed.
Attempted to add a debounce feature to the 10 seconds recordings but proved unsuccesful.
