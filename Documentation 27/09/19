Week 1:

To begin, a button feature was assembled on the Arduino Mega.

-Connected to DCD driver


Week 2:


Succesfully connected to the bluetooth feather
Received output on DCD driver


Goal:
Adjusted Arduino code to have button communicating with the server

- Added button characteristics (Arduino)
- reading value button by added line (Arduino)
- Changed button line for: AT+GATTADDCHAR=

- Ran "9999" as a test

- Failed to  ble.print( buttonCharId );

- Failed: Did not deliver end of string

- Adjusted MIN_LEN=1,MAX_LEN=30 to deliver required amount of variables

- Pyton: # UUID of the GATT characteristic to subscribe to button

- re-enaled: Subscribing the GATT service which was controversial?!

- Python: added: handle_button_data(handle, value_bytes)




Got feather to work:
- Edit output.

Wanted to do button to server

Changed:
App to server
raspberry pi to server

Edit data on the server.

Today: Accelorameter on frame.

Test: Different characteristics of terrain.
If > ...
Measure Zero and peak values without server

Week 3

switched from hotspot to eduroam connection
now working with pi@145.94.250.175

did this by making .services which can run in the background
and get started on startup.

ran into problems connecting over ssh. probably used wrong ip.
Also found out that wrong python was installed now updated to 3.5.3
