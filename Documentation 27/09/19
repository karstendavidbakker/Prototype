Received output on DCD driver


Goal:
Adjusted Arduino code to have button communicating with the server

- Added button characteristics (Arduino)
- reading value button by added line (Arduino)
- Changed button line for: AT+GATTADDCHAR=

- Ran "9999" as a test

- Failed to  ble.print( buttonCharId );
